**Projects**

- HMM Part-of-Speech Tagger: A Python implementation of Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging
  - Calculated initial, transition and observation probabilities from text-tag pairs in training files. Used an HMM model to calculate tag probabilities for words.
  - Optimized word tagging of unseen words in training files by 15%
  - Achieved 90% POS word-tagging accuracy on both tagged and untagged text


- [Checkers-AlphaBeta Search](https://github.com/alexszokolay/Checkers-AlphaBetaSearch): A Python implementation of Checkers and AlphaBeta Search to solve Checkers endgame puzzles.
  - Developed a state-based implementation of Checkers, including a function to generate all successors of a current board state.
  - Developed effective evaluation and utility functions to facilitate Alpha-Beta pruning.
  - Improved program efficiency by 25% using Node-Ordering and State Caching.

- [Hua-Rong-Dao-Search](https://github.com/alexszokolay/Hua-Rong-Dao-Search): An implementation of Depth-First Search and A* Search to solve the Hua Rong Dao sliding puzzle.
  - Developed a state-based implementation of Hua Rong Dao, including a function to generate all successors of a current board state.
  - Developed DFS and A* algorithms to find valid and optimal paths from board states to solution states.
  - Achieved 100% accuracy on A*


- [Travel Therapy](https://github.com/alexszokolay/Uoft-ECKS): Developed at [UofT Hacks](https://www.uofthacks.com/), a Discord Travel Therapy Bot that recommends different places around the city based on a user’s current mental state.
  - Used the Discord Python API for direct integration and interaction with the bot in Discord
  - Queried optimal locations according to user’s preferences using Co:Here; a platform for natural language processing 
 

- [AWS Certified Cloud Practioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/): A course teaching a foundational understanding of AWS Cloud concepts, services, and terminology.

- [NewtApp](https://newt.social/): A social media platform where users can have conversations in limited sizes, featuring user-made discussion boards.
  - Developed an object-oriented backend in Java for facilitating users, and conversations. 
  - Integrated our Java backend with a PostgreSQL database for storing data.
  - Developed front-end using JavaScript, React, CSS and HTML
