Hi, I'm Alex! I am third year student at the University of Toronto. I'm currently studying Computer Science, Cognitive Science and Psychology.

I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for technology, and 4+ years of experience in programming languages such as Python and Java, and a deep understanding of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, Spring, Postgres, and React.

As a team player with supervisory experience who can also excel with independent work, I am interested in expanding my skill set and applying knowledge and experience from my program to solve real-world problems in the workforce. 


Below are some of the projects I'm working on/have worked on recently:
